 Give me, give me, give me some time to think I'm in the bathroom looking at me Facing the mirror is all I need Went into the Reaper takes my life Never gonna get me out alive I will live a thousand million lives My patience is waning Is this entertaining? My patience is waning Is this entertaining? I, I, I got this feeling Yeah, you know where I'm losing my control There's this magic in my bones I, I, I got this feeling with my soul Though I had it though you're still There's this magic in my bones Playing with the stick, got dynamite There was never gray and black and white There was never wrong till there was right Feeling like a ball to huddle in Seeing all the vouchers circling Burning in the flames I'm working in Turning in the bed is dark and lean My patience is waning Is this entertaining? My patience is waning Is this entertaining? I, I, I got this feeling Yeah, you know where I'm losing my control There's this magic in my bones I, I, I, I got this feeling with my soul Though I had it though you're still There's this magic in my bones The mirror of my mind Turning the pages of my life Walking the path so many Paced a million times Drown out the voices in the air Leaving the ones that never cared Picking the pieces I've been building to the sky My patience is waning Is this entertaining? My patience is waning Is this entertaining? I, I, I got this feeling Yeah, you know where I'm losing my control There's this magic in my bones I, I, I, I got this feeling with my soul Though I had it though you're still There's this magic in my bones I, I, I, I got this feeling Yeah, you know where I'm losing my control There's this magic in my bones I, I, I, I got this feeling Yeah, you know where I'm losing my control There's this magic in my bones Thanks for watching!
